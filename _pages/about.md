PhD student in NLP at Sorbonne University since 2022, I work on the automatic recognition of unfrozen expressions. After obtaining my master's degree in Language and Computer Science at Sorbonne University, I decided to start a PhD under the supervision of [GaÃ«l Lejeune](https://www.lejeunegael.fr/), [Antoine Gautier](https://sites.google.com/site/antoinegautier1/enseignements) and [Gilles Siouffi](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/personnes/gilles-siouffi).

Interests
======

For the moment, I am interested in the nature of the exchanges between computer science and language science. Like many people, I think that these two disciplines have a lot to contribute to each other.  This is one of the lines of thought of my PhD : Can we imagine that by a virtuous circle phenomenon, automated processing can refine the linguistic description at the same time as it allows to adjust the computer tools ?
