About this course
======

I was a teaching assistant for this database course, given by [KarÃ«n Fort](https://members.loria.fr/KFort/), for 1 year.

The goal of the course is to introduce students to database principles. During this course, we first teach them how to model databases before moving on to a more practical approach with SQL.
