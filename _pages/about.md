PhD student in NLP at Sorbonne University since 2022, I work on the automatic recognition of unfrozen expressions. After obtaining my master's degree in Language and Computer Science at Sorbonne University, I decided to start a PhD under the supervision of [GaÃ«l Lejeune](https://www.lejeunegael.fr/), [Antoine Gautier](https://sites.google.com/site/antoinegautier1/enseignements) and [Gilles Siouffi](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/personnes/gilles-siouffi).
